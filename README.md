# icosa
The common library used by the websites created by HIVDB team

## Development

The development environment of Icosa requires NodeJS and Yarn. Once the latest versions installed:

```bash
cd icosa
yarn && yarn start
```

This command will host a service on http://localhost:3009. It requires [Sierra-HIV](https://github.com/hivdb/sierra)/[Sierra-SARS2](https://github.com/hivdb/sierra-sars2) running as the backends for running/developing the HIV/SARS-CoV-2 Sequence Analysis Programs.
